# Free-Agent-Starting-and-Relief-Pitchers
This is my most in-depth repository yet! Starting off we have a simple linear regression comparing pitcher strikeout % to team winning %. Then, we select the pitchers who are free agents for this year and analyze their strikeout % (seperated by starting & relief pitchers). This can give us information on what pitchers could have a positive impact on a team's winning %!
